# Space Maze


Space Maze is a maze game where the user has to reach the finish line at each of the five levels as fast as possible.  Inside the maze you will find time reducers that deduct the total time of each level and wormholes that will spit you out to a random location in the maze.  Space maze was built with react and redux with an api backend that uses pg-promise.  This allowed us to use CRUD operations on a database hosted on AWS. The project was created in a team enviroment that utilized our full-stack web development skills in an agile fashion in two weeks' time.
